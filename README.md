## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment
## Idea
The idea is to create a user-friendly, informative, and engaging platform that empowers individuals to make a positive impact on the environment by responsibly managing their electronic waste. By combining practical tools for finding recycling facilities with educational resources and incentives for recycling, the website aims to promote a culture of sustainability and responsible consumption.

## Proposed idea / architecture diagram

1. **Database of E-Waste Facilities**: Start by compiling a comprehensive database of e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Include information such as their locations, operating hours, accepted items, and contact details.

2. **Interactive Map Interface**: Design an interactive map interface where users can enter their location or allow the website to access their location to find the nearest e-waste facility. The map should provide clear directions and information about each facility.

3. **Educational Content**: Integrate educational pop-ups or sections throughout the website to inform users about the harmful components of e-waste and their impact on the environment and human health. You could include articles, infographics, videos, or interactive modules to make the learning experience engaging.

4. **Device Input and Credit Points System**: Create a feature where users can input the model of their old device. Based on this information, calculate the estimated amount of precious metals and other valuable materials that can be recovered from the device through recycling. Offer users credit points or rewards relative to the value of the materials recovered. 

5. **User Accounts and Rewards System**: Implement a user account system where users can track their recycling activity, earn points for each recycled item, and redeem rewards such as discounts on new electronics or donations to environmental organizations.

6. **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensure that the website is mobile-friendly, as many users may access it from their smartphones while on the go.

7. **Partnerships and Outreach**: Collaborate with e-waste recycling companies, environmental organizations, and government agencies to promote the website and encourage participation in responsible e-waste disposal practices.

8. **Feedback and Improvement**: Gather feedback from users to continually improve the website's functionality and user experience. Regularly update the database of e-waste facilities to ensure accuracy and inclusivity.

By combining user convenience with educational resources and incentives, you can create a platform that not only facilitates e-waste recycling but also raises awareness about its importance for environmental sustainability.
